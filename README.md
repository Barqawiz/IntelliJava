# IntelliJava-OpenaiAPI
*IntelliJava V0.1 beta*

IntelliJava allows java developers to easily integrate with the latest language models and deep learning frameworks like GPT-3 using few lines of code.
The first version supports only Openai APIs. It provides a simple and intuitive API with convenient methods for sending text input to GPT-3 and receiving generated text in return.

# How to use
1. Import the core jar file to your project [intellijava.jar](https://insta-answer-public.s3.amazonaws.com/opensource/IntelliJava/version0.1/com.intellijava.core-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar).
2. Add gson dependency using maven or the jar file (check the dependencies section).
3. Call the RemoteLanguageModel as described in the code example.

# Code Example
```
// 1- initiate the remote language model 
String apiKey = "<todo-add-api-key>";
RemoteLanguageModel wrapper = new RemoteLanguageModel(apiKey, "openai");

// 2- call generateText with any command !
String command = "write a java code that says hello wrold";
String resValue = wrapper.generateText("text-davinci-002", command, 0.5F, 100);
```
For full example check the samples projects inside sample_code folder.
